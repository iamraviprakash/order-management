## Grocery Orders Dashboard

### Introduction
This is single page application developed using React for listing and searching groceries orders.

### Task Overview
The aim is to show the orders list on a dashboard in a comprehensive way so that the user doesn't get overwhelmed with the amount of the data as well as application performance should also be good.

#### Pain points and Solution
  * **More than 100 rows of data are available to render:** This can be solved by using pagination. Show only some amount (around 10-15 orders) of data per page. It eventually leads to faster rendering.
  * **Grocery items listing:** List of items can be more than 3 or 4(probably in some other dataset). In that case, hide the rest of the data and display it in a dialog box. It improves the UI visibility and content readability.
